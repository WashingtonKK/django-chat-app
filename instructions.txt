The chat app runs in the local host at https://127.0.1:8000
The interface is designed in HTML and CSS

To build the server, I used Django-channels, used primarily for chat applications.
The service is an asynchronous chat application.
Furthermore I have used redis, 

To run the program, the following requirements are needed.
	1. Python
	2. Django
	3. Memurai (In place of Redis that does not work on windows)
	4. Django-channels
	5. Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 Developer tools (I realised that I did not have them even though I thought I did)
	6. 
Some of the dependencies can be instsalled via download (Python, Memurai) while Django is installed usign Pip on windows
The install on other operating systems is not covered here but is available on google search.

When you receive the folder, navigate to the justchat fodler that has the file manage.py and run the command;
		
		python manage.py runserver

If all goes well you should see a bunch of statements, the final one being;
	Starting ASGI/Channels version 2.4.0 development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
	Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.

Then to test your work you can go to the local host at 
		http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat

which will ask you for the chat room you want to enter, once joined to the room you can chat with the other people in
the same room. (You can open the same link [http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat/room-name] in a different web browser[incognito]
and check the results.
